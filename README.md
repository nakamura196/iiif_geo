## üìñ Data

This viewer supports two types of IIIF data formats:

### 1. IIIF Canvas with Georeference Extension

Prepare a JSON file following the Full Canvas Example of the Georeference Extension.

https://iiif.io/api/extension/georef/#41-full-canvas-example

Example Canvas file:
- https://nakamura196.github.io/iiif_geo/canvas.json
- https://nakamura196.github.io/iiif_geo/canvas_extra.json

### 2. IIIF Manifest with Georeference Extension

You can also use a full IIIF Presentation API 3.0 Manifest that includes one or more Canvases with georeference annotations.

Example Manifest file:
- https://nakamura196.github.io/iiif_geo/manifest.json

The viewer will automatically detect whether the provided URL is a Manifest or a Canvas and display the georeferenced content accordingly.

### Extra metadata fields

Extra metadata fields can be added to the Feature data.

```json
{
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {
        "resourceCoords": [
            6690,
            7517
        ]
    },
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
            139.7623182,
            35.7151233
        ]
    },
    "metadata": {
        "id": "http://example.org/dJdXXQEA8dWSptgt8",
        "label": "ÈõªÊ∞óÂÆüÈ®ìÂÆ§",
        "tags": ["Â∑•Â≠¶ÈÉ®"],
        "url": "https://maps.app.goo.gl/dJdXXQEA8dWSptgt8",
        "xywh": "5936,6344,976,1384",
    }
}
```

The `metadata` field is used to display the label, tags, and URL of the place.

| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| id | URI of the place | False | String |
| label | Label of the place | False | String |
| tags | Tags of the place | False | Array |
| url | URL of the place | False | String |
